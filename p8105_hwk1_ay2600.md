## Problem 1

``` r
library(moderndive)
data("early_january_weather")
?early_january_weather
```

The `early_january_weather` dataset provides a comprehensive snapshot of
hourly meteorological readings for January 2013 at the Newark
International Airport: EWR. This dataset is sourced from the `weather`
data frame within the `nycflights13` package.

### Variables in the Dataset

- **origin**: Denotes the weather station. The station is EWR.
- **year, month, day, hour**: Precisely time of recording.
- **temp and dewp**: Represent temperature and dew point both in
  Fahrenheit.
- **humid**: Provides the relative humidity as a percentage.
- **wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust**: Offer insights into wind
  patterns, including its direction (in degrees), speed, and gust speed,
  all in mph.
- **precip**: Measures precipitation in inches.
- **pressure**: Notes the sea-level pressure in millibars.
- **visib**: Reflects visibility in miles.
- **time_hour**: Captures both the date and hour of the recording as a
  `POSIXct` date.

### Size of the Dataset

- The dataset consists of 358 rows, representing hourly recordings, and
  15 variables.

### Mean Temperature

- The average temperature observed during this period is 39.5821229°F.

### Scatterplot

``` r
library(ggplot2)

plot <- ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Temperature vs. Time of Day", 
       x = "Time (Date)", 
       y = "Temperature (°F)") + 
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(20, 60)) + 
  scale_x_datetime(breaks = "4 days") +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = as.POSIXct(c("2013-01-01", "2013-01-16"))) + 
  theme_minimal()

print(plot)
```

```

    ## Saving 7 x 5 in image

Between January 1, 2013, and January 15, 2013, the data indicates a
general upward trend in the daily mean temperature. Additionally, during
this period, no discernible pattern was observed between humidity and
the time of day.

## Problem 2

``` r
set.seed(123) 
df <- data.frame(
  sample_normal = rnorm(10),
  logical_vector = rnorm(10) > 0,
  char_vector = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"),
  factor_vector = factor(sample(c("Level 1", "Level 2", "Level 3"), 10, replace = TRUE))
)
```

``` r
mean(df$sample_normal)  
```

    ## [1] 0.07462564

``` r
mean(df$logical_vector) 
```

    ## [1] 0.7

``` r
mean(df$char_vector)    
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(df$char_vector): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(df$factor_vector)  
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(df$factor_vector): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

The random sample and logical vector are able to take mean. However,
character vector and factor vector are not able to take mean.

``` r
as.numeric(df$logical_vector)
as.numeric(df$char_vector)
as.numeric(df$factor_vector)
```

After applying the as.numeric function, logical variables are converted
to numerical values, with TRUE represented as 1 and FALSE as 0. Factor
vectors also undergo successful conversion to numerical values,
corresponding to the levels of the factor. However, character vector
fail to convert to numerical values because it lack a direct mapping
from characters to numbers.

Yes, `as.numeric` function is helpful to understand deeper about the
types of variable and coercion.
